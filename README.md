📌 Overview

Well-Wisher AI is a digital mental health and psychological support system designed for students in higher education.
It provides empathetic AI-powered conversations, mood tracking, wellness reminders, and emergency support, ensuring students receive timely guidance, reflection tools, and crisis alerts.

This project addresses the rising mental health concerns among students by combining conversational AI, predictive analytics, and accessible digital tools into a scalable platform.

🎯 Problem Statement

Students in higher education often face stress, anxiety, and depression due to academic and personal pressures. Traditional counseling is limited by stigma, accessibility, and availability of professionals.
There is a need for a 24/7, accessible, secure, and empathetic digital assistant to provide immediate psychological support and wellness guidance.
